## 04 - Module Bundlers

### What is a Module Bundler?

- A tool that takes all of your source code, which is usually multiple files and bundles them together, often times, into a single build file
  - Examples: Webpack, Snowpack, Parcel, Vite
  - Will be using Webpack here (arguably the most difficult of the four above)
