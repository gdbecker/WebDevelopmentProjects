### Project Details

This is a refactored version of the first Tracalorie app - now configured with Webpack!

Full stack application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript! Set your daily calorie limit with the form button at the top. Add meals & workouts as you go about your day to keep track of where you stand on your calories and how well you're doing. If you made a mistake somewhere you can easily delete meals or workouts, and dynamically filter down your content with separate filter bars. At the start of a new day click on the reset button up top to refresh everything.
