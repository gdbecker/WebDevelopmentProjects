## 04 - Data Types

### Primitive Data Types

- String: sequence of characters, must be in quotes or backticks
- Number: integers as well as floating-point numbers
- Boolean: logical entity / true or false
- Null: intentional absence of any object value
- Undefined: a variable that has not yet been defined or assigned
- Symbol: built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
- BigInt: numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle

### Reference Types (Objects)

- Non-primitive value and then assigned to a variable, the variable is given a reference to that value
- Object literals, arrays, and functions are all reference types

### Static Typing vs Dynamic Typing

- JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means we do not explicitly define the types for our variables. Many other languages are statically-typed such as C, C++, and Java
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and does allow static-typing. This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors
