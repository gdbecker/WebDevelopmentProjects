## 10 - Capitalize Challenge

We have arrived at our first challenge. Every once in a while I'm going to ask you to figure out a problem or do something using what we have already learned. I will not ask you to do a challenge that involves doing something that we have not yet gone over.

If you feel stuck and can not figure it out on your own, that is absolutely fine. I will walk you through the solution(s), so that you can understand how to solve the problem.

**Instructions**:

Take the variable `myString` and capitalize the first letter of the word using some of the methods that we talked about in the last video. Put the result in a variable called `myNewString`.

Create multiple solutions if you would like.

**Expected Result:**

```JavaScript
const myString = 'developer';

console.log(myNewString); // 'Developer'
```

**Hints:**

1. You can use the `charAt()` method as well as `string[index]` to get the character at a specific index.
2. The `.toUpperCase()` method will make the entire string uppercase
3. `substring()` or `slice()` will return a specific portion of a string
