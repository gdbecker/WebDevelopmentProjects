## 04 - Block Scope

### Topics Covered

- Using "var" in a block like a loop or conditional statement allows you to access outside of the block
- But using "var" inside a function limits the scope to that function -> cannot access the var variable outside of the function
- Try to use "const" and "let" more often inside block elements, including functions
