#### Description
This is a 36+ hour in-depth course that will take you from the absolute beginning of JavaScript, learning about data types, functions and loops to learning DOM manipulation, asynchronous JS with promises, async/await and much more. You will even learn how to write unit tests for algorithms. We go into how JavaScript works under the hood including execution context, the call stack, event loop, etc. We learn about Webpack tooling and how to create a modern development environment. At the end, we build a Node.js/Express API with a custom Webpack frontend.

All of the code in the learning modules will go into a folder called "JavaScript Sandbox". This is so we can keep things organized and you can always refer back to it for any code snippets that you may need. All of the final and starter code for the projects is included as well as links to the GitHub Repos.

What you will learn:
- Basics & Fundamentals: Data types, let & const variables, functions, conditionals, loops, object literals, etc
- Data Structures - Arrays, objects, maps, sets as well as custom data structures like stacks and queues
- DOM Manipulation - Selectors, traversing the DOM, show/hide, creating & removing elements, event listeners
- OOP - Constructor functions, prototypes, inheritance, classes, protected properties, getters/setters
- Async JS - Ajax & XHR, Fetch API, callbacks, promises, async / await
- Error Handling - Try...Catch, HTTP errors
- Web & Browser APIs - Canvas, geolocation, audio/video, web animations API
- Modules & Tooling - CommonJS & ES Modules, Webpack,  plugins, loaders, modern dev environment &  workflow
- Unit Testing Algorithms - Learn the Jest testing library and algorithms like palindromes and anagrams
- Node.js & Express - Learn about Node modules, NPM packages and build a REST API with Express & MongoDB
- Full Stack Development - We build an API with Express and a frontend with Webpack. No frontend frameworks!
- So So Much More!
