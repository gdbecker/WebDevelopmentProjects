## What is a Type System?

### Types

- What are they? Easy ways to refer to the different properties & functions that a value has
- Value = anything we assign to a variable
- Example: "red"
  - It's a String
  - It is a value that has all the properties and methods that we assume that a String has
- Types we've seen before:
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Date
  - Custom object literal, like a 'Todo' with ids, titles, completed, etc
- Two overall categories
  - Primitive Types: number, boolean, string symbol, void, null, undefined
  - Object Types: functions, classes, objects, arrays

### Why do we care about types?

- Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
