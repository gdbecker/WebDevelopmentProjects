## Mastering Typed Arrays

### Typed Arrays

- Definition: arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

### Why do we care?

- TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array
- TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array
- We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions
- Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

### Where to used typed arrays?

- Any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order
