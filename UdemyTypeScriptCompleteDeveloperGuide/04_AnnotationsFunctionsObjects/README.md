## Annotations with Functions and Objects

### Type annotations for functions

- Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of arguments will receive and what type of values it will return

### Type inference for functions

- TypeScript tries to figure out what type of value a function will return

### Type annotations for objects

- For destructuring, you also need to specifically annotate the types for each destructured attribute
